## Hubble images from here  https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2019/17/4492-Image.html?Tag=Hubble%2520Ultra%2520Deep%2520Field&page=1 
the problem with this image is that has a weird polygonal border for all resolutions

so I worked with this one: 
https://esahubble.org/media/archives/images/original/heic0611b.tif which comes fromm here https://esahubble.org/images/heic0611b/
